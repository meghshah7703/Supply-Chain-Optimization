We have built a web application which gives the minimum cost for manufacturing a particular product depending on the manufacturer. Our application is not confined to a particular industry. The briefing of the working is done below.
User of our application can be from any of these categories:
● Manufacturer
● Supplier
● Distributor
● Transporter
Firstly the user has to register his/her company under the category that it falls. Based on the category user will have different functions that he/she can perform. We have a different user interface for each of them.
There will be several suppliers registered on the platform along with the cities/towns from where they are based. The supplier will enter the number of goods he/she holds and price for the same. We have also taken transportation cost into consideration so cities/towns play an important role.
Distributors are the middleman between supplier and manufacturer. They’ll be responsible for distribution of raw material or producing an intermediate raw material required by the manufacturer.
Transporter will have the cost per km for each raw material to be transported.
The manufacturer will enter the requirements of raw materials for producing one unit of finished product for all the products that he/she produces.
So what our platform does is, when the manufacturer enters the amount of finished good to be produced it will calculate the amount of raw material required individually and suggest him from where the manufacturer must purchase the raw materials so the final cost of production is optimum.
